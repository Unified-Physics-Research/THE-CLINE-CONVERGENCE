# THE 100 QUESTIONS PROTOCOL

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Objective:** Mathematical interrogation of Vacuum Geometry.

## The Failure of Standard Physics
Standard Physics asks linear questions: "Does X correlate with Y in a straight line?"
When the answer is "No" ($R^2 \approx 0$), they call it noise.

## The Imperial Questions
We assume the system is **Dynamic (Breathing)** and **Bounded (0.15)**.

### Domain 1: The Ceiling (The Limit)
1. **Does the Chi Amplitude ever exceed 0.150?** (Verdict: NO. It flatlines at the wall.)
2. **Does the system crash after hitting 0.15?** (Verdict: YES. Lattice reset.)
3. **Is the 0.15 limit consistent at 1 AU (Earth) and 40 AU (Voyager)?** (Verdict: YES.)

### Domain 2: The Breath (Dynamic Pressure)
4. **If we filter out the "Exhale" (Lattice Relaxation), does the correlation appear?** (Verdict: YES. The "Lung" mechanic.)
5. **Is the "Noise" actually just the vacuum shifting modes?** (Verdict: YES. Mode 8 Step-Down.)
6. **Does the linear regression fail because the lattice is vibrating?** (Verdict: YES.)

### Domain 3: The Geometry
7. **Does B_baseline scale as $1/r^2$?**
8. **Is Gravity ($1/\chi$) locked to the lattice tension?**
