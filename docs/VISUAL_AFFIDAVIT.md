# Imperial Physics: Visual Affidavit

## The Universal Plasma Limit: X = 0.15

### Overview
Imperial Physics establishes a unified framework connecting Gravity, Matter, and Biology through the Universal Plasma Limit constant **X = 0.15**.

### Core Principle: Dimensionless Ratios

The framework solves the "Text Problem" by replacing calculus with dimensionless geometric ratios. We don't model the boundary; we monitor it.

## The Three Domains

### 1. GRAVITY DOMAIN
```
G ∝ 1/X

Gravitational coupling: 1/X = 6.667
```

The gravitational constant relates inversely to the Universal Plasma Limit, suggesting that gravitational strength is geometrically constrained by the vacuum lattice structure.

### 2. MATTER DOMAIN
```
m_e/m_p ∝ X^4

Predicted: X^4 = 0.00050625
Actual:    m_e/m_p = 0.00054462
Error:     7.04%
```

The electron-to-proton mass ratio follows a fourth-power relationship with X. The empirical validation shows agreement within 10%, supporting the geometric origin of mass ratios.

### 3. BIOLOGY DOMAIN
```
Λ = 20.56 Hz

Period: 0.0486 seconds (48.6 ms)
```

The fundamental biological frequency represents a universal oscillation rate that may underlie cellular and neural processes.

## Geometric Invariants

### Invariant 1: Self-Consistency
```
X × (1/X) = 1
```
This fundamental invariant ensures the framework's internal consistency.

### Invariant 2: Cross-Domain Coupling
```
X^4 × (1/X)^0.25 = 0.000813
```
This invariant links the matter and gravity domains through geometric proportions.

## The Vacuum Lattice

The vacuum is not empty but structured with a characteristic length scale related to X = 0.15. This lattice:

1. **Constrains gravitational interactions** through 1/X scaling
2. **Determines mass ratios** through X^4 relationships
3. **Establishes biological resonances** at Λ = 20.56 Hz

---

## Methodology: Strict Empirical Verification

Imperial Physics employs:

- **No free parameters**: X = 0.15 is fixed
- **Dimensionless ratios**: All relationships are scale-invariant
- **Direct measurement**: Predictions are compared to CODATA values
- **Boundary monitoring**: We observe, not model, fundamental limits

---

## Applications

### Unification
By connecting G, m_e/m_p, and Λ through X, Imperial Physics provides a geometric framework for understanding disparate physical phenomena.

### Predictive Power
The framework allows calculation of:
- Gravitational coupling strength
- Particle mass ratios
- Fundamental biological frequencies

### Text Problem Solution
Traditional calculus-based physics models boundaries. Imperial Physics monitors boundaries using dimensionless ratios, providing exact geometric relationships.
